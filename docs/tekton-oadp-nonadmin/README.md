# Create a project and user with non-admin access that can execute an OADP backup

## Background
The purpose of this demonstration is to provide an example for OpenShift administrators and users how an admistrator may configure OADP and OpenShift Pipelines to provide non-adminstrators access to trigger an OADP backup and restore workflow.

This example uses [OpenShift Pipelines](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/introducing-openshift-pipelines) and configures a tekton pipeline for a non-admin user that has access to OADP resources to trigger a backup.  The non-admin user can execute the pipeline but can not edit the pipeline.  The administrator is allowed to configure OADP for their users, and users can execute a backup or restore as needed with out the administrator intervention.

An OpenShift administrator would want to ensure that an application developer or namespace administrator could not backup or restore applications where they do not have the proper rights or access.  In this demo, the administrator has only given the user rights to backup a namespace called `nginx-example`.  The administrator has also specificied the DPA for this backup to `dpa-sample`.  An OpenShift administrator should configure different DPA per non-admin owner.  This provides the administrator the oversight where and how backups are taken, and the users the convienence of executing backups and restores as they wish.

## Alternatives
It is possible to install the OADP Operator into multiple OpenShift namespaces and give namespace ownwers and project admins the ability to configure their own OADP settings, configuration and of course the ability to execute backups and restores.   The OADP team has [FAQ page](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5456281#can-i-install-oadp-into-multiple-openshift-projects-to-enable-project-owners-26) that covers this scenario and will be building out documentation for it soon.  There are advantages and disadvantages to either workflow. In this case using OpenShift Pipelines better constrains what OpenShift non-admin users can execute with cluster level access. In other words it can prevent non-admins from accidently destroying the wrong namespace.


## Technical Details of this demonstration

A user may want to change the backup custom resource, or other aspects of this demo. Simply fork this git repository and update the settings and configuration. The following provides a more in depth technical specification.

* To change the backup customer resource, update the [backup cr](backup_cr/backup.yaml)
* The oauth and some of the user settings can be found in the [demo_users](demo_users) directory
* Some of the templates used in this demonstration are templated and found in [install_templates/templates](install_templates). The [install.sh](install.sh) script executes `oc process` to substitute variables and renders to the directory of the users choice or by default to `/tmp/oadp_non_admin` 
* Once the manifects have been rendered the install.sh script also apply's the templates.
* The install.sh script will also execute `oc adm policy add-role-to-user view $USER` to give the non-admin rights to view all the resources in the created namespace.
* The parameters that users are allowed to set in the tekton pipeline are defined in [05-build-and-deploy.yaml](install_templates/templates/05-build-and-deploy.yaml). Currently the non-admin user can set the following details
  * The git url to the source of the backup_cr file
  * The git branch of the git url
  * The backup name that will be added to the backup cr and executed.
  * Additional paramaters can be added based on your needs.

Future examples or updates to this documentation could include the following:
 * A custom built tekton compatible container with backup and restore customer resource templates.
   *  A custom built container would reduce the number of steps required in the pipeline.
 * setup multiple users as namespace owners
   * multiple tekton pipelines per owner
 * multiple applications
 * multiple DPA configurations

## Steps

### Prerequisites
* Check that [OADP is installed](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/about-installing-oadp.html) and [configured with a DPA named dpa-sample](https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/install_olm.md#create-the-dataprotectionapplication-custom-resource)
* Check that the [nginx-example sample application](https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/examples/stateless.md) is installed

```
./check_prerequisites.sh -h
Check the prerequisites [-h|-i]
options:
h     Print this Help.
i     Install nginx-example

[whayutin@thinkdoe tekton-oadp-nonadmin]$
```


### First create non-admin users 
* **NOTE** Be careful as to not overwrite or delete your existing authentication. 
  *  This step can easily be done manually and the script skipped by executing the steps documented [here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/openshift-htpasswd-oauth)  
* logged in as the kubeadmin user, execute the following:
```
cd demo_users
./create_demousers.sh -h
Create the OADP non-admin users

Syntax: scriptTemplate [-h|-n|-c|-p|-d]
options:
h     Print this Help.
n     demouser base name
c     the number of users to be created
p     the common password
d     The directory where the htpasswd file will be saved

```

Example:
```
./create_demousers.sh -n buzz -c 2
```
This will create two new users in openshift called buzz1 and buzz2 with a default password of `passw0rd`.

* Please first confirm that you can log in as the demo user.  **NOTE:** It may take a few moments for the OCP oauth settings to reconcile. 

* If you are logged in as the admin, please log into OCP with the buzz user in another browser.
  * Please note your permissions once logged in.
  * Also note there are no pipelines created.

### Setup the Tekton pipelines 

* logged in as the kubeadmin user, execute the following:

Using an example with a user called buzz1 in a project called buzz1
```
./install.sh -h
Create the OADP non-admin templates

Syntax: scriptTemplate [-h|-p|-u|-d]
options:
h     Print this Help.
p     Name of the Project or Namespace
u     Name of the non-admin user
d     The directory where the templates will be saved


./install.sh -p buzz1 -u buzz1 -d /tmp/buzz1
```

The project will be created and the user updated.

* Navigate to the pipelines menu as the buzz1 user

* You should now see a new tekton pipeline created call `backup-pipeline`
  * Click `Actions`
    * **NOTE** you should see the user only has permissions to `Start` the pipeline
  * Click `Start`
    * Update the GIT_URL and GIT_BRANCH 
      * This is for demonstration purposes only and will later be removed.
      * The git repo should be a clone of oadp-operator and contain the directory `docs/tekton-oadp-nonadmin`
    * Give your backup an unique name
    * The `workspace` should be:
      * A PersistentVolumeClaim
      * Choose the $name-oadp-non-admin PVC

* Watch and wait for the backup to complete

* Check the logs of the Tekton tasks, below is an example of a previous execution.
